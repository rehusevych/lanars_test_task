# lanars_test_task

Hi, this is a test challenge project from Lanars company.

in this project, all tasks marked [x] were done, as well as some marked [xx]:

- [xx] User stays logged in until logout action
- [xx] There is a user avatar
- [xx] There is a user full name
- [xx] There is a user email
- [xx] There should be a confirmation dialog to log out.
- [xx] Users should have an option to cancel the log out process.
- [xx] After successful log out, users are redirected to the login page.
- [xx] As a user I can search by name so that I can find desired kind
- [xx] The search starts from the 3d symbol
- [xx] The search throttle time is 1000 ms
- [xx] There is an option to clear search input

I wanted to finish all the functionality, but I'm already late with the submission due to illness and work, so for now I'll drop it like this.

The project uses Flutter version 3.16.8 and Dart version 3.2.5. To launch the project, you can simply launch the main functions or, if you use VSCode, create a file called launch.json and insert the configuration into it. I will attach it below:

```json
{

  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "debug",
      "request": "launch",
      "type": "dart"
    },
    {
      "name": "profile",
      "request": "launch",
      "type": "dart",
      "flutterMode": "profile"
    },
    {
      "name": "release",
      "request": "launch",
      "type": "dart",
      "flutterMode": "release"
    }
  ]
}
```
